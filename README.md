# AI & ML Portfolio 🚀🤖

This portfolio is the result of my **self-learning journey in AI & ML**.  
I started with curiosity, then used **ChatGPT as a learning assistant** and followed tutorials to understand the fundamentals.  
From there, I gradually built and implemented these projects myself — step by step, debugging, experimenting, and improving along the way.  

My goal wasn’t just to finish tutorials, but to truly **understand core ML concepts** and apply them in practice.  
This collection reflects how I moved from simple models (like logistic regression) to more advanced architectures (CNNs, LSTMs) while learning how to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
