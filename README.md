# AI & ML Portfolio 🚀🤖

This repository contains a collection of 5 machine learning and deep learning projects I built to **learn core AI/ML concepts** and to showcase them on my GitHub.  
Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualizations and relevant comments to make it easy to understand.
